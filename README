"Yo rabbit, Trixx are for hackers"

The goal of Trixx is to build an administration and monitoring tool for RabbitMQ.
Trixx is written in Clojure and, therefore, is available for all languages that 
run on JVM.

Features of Trixx:

* add exchange
* delete exchange
* list exchanges
* add queue
* delete queue
* list queues
* add binding
* list bindings
* stop app
* start app
* reset
* add vhost
* delete vhost
* list vhosts
* add user
* delete user
* list users
* list connections
* set permissions
* clear permissions
* list vhost permissions
* list user permissions

Currently, there is no user interface associated with Trixx, but the eventual 
goal is to provide a nice web interface (hopefully in the next few weeks).  Also,
the core code is likely to change drastically in the next few months because of
heavy development.

At the moment, all the features provided by Trixx are also provided by
rabbitmqctl command line utility, which ships with RabbitMQ.  So you can
think of the core of Trixx as an API around rabbitmqctl for JVM languages.

Trixx was started as an experiment to learn more about Clojure and RabbitMQ. 
During my experiment, many people expressed interest in such a tool. So 
I am making this freely available in hopes that people will find it useful and 
possibly contribute to the project.

I also wrote a Scala version of Trixx for the same reason.  However, 
I will probably only continue the development only with the Clojure version.  
But if you are interested in building out the Scala version please let me know.
I'll include the source in a contrib folder for anyone that is interested.

Trixx requires RabbitMQ Java client and RabbitMQ broker from the hg repository, 
changeset: 329:f4073af3d546 and changeset: 1054:fce2dad390ee respectively.  
However, some features might work with the released version of the broker.
For example, the ACL feature is only in trunk version of the broker at this time,
so attempts to use permissions related functionalities in Trixx will result in error.
Since Trixx directly communicates with Erlang nodes, it requires JInterface.  Trixx
is using Erlang 6.5 at the time of this writing.


Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build from source:

  ant fetch-deps compile-rabbit-server compile-rabbit-java-client jar

Note that we've included a specific version of RabbitMQ at this time.
You'll have to have Erlang installed and RabbitMQ it will get built by
the compile-rabbit-server target.

Then in seperate terminals:

  ant run-rabbit
  ant run-trixx

Then open a browser to http://localhost:8080/exchanges
