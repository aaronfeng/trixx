= ActiveRecordBaseWithoutTable

Get the power of ActiveRecord models, including validation, without having a table in the database.
This plugin now works with Rails 2.2.2.

== Installation

=== Gem

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    # ...
    config.gem 'splattael-activerecord_base_without_table', :lib    => 'activerecord_base_without_table',
                                                            :source => 'http://gems.github.com'

    # ...
  end

=== Rails plugin

  script/plugin install git://github.com/splattael/activerecord_base_without_table.git

== Usage

  class Contact < ActiveRecord::BaseWithoutTable
    column :name, :string
    column :email_address, :string
    column :message, :text
    
    validates_presence_of :name, :email_address, :string
  end

This model can be used just like a regular model based on a table, except it will never be saved to the database.
